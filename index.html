                                What is a planet? The word goes back to the ancient Greek word planēt, 
                                and it means "wanderer." A more modern definition can be found in the Merriam-Webster 
                                dictionary which defines a planet as "any of the large bodies that revolve around 
                                the Sun in the solar system."
                                <br><br>
                                In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) - a group of astronomers that 
                                names objects in our solar system - agreed on their own definition of the word "planet." 
                                This new definition changed caused Pluto's famous "demotion" to a dwarf planet.

                    <p>
                        Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, 
                        <a class="underline-text-link" href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto" target="_blank">five officially named dwarf planets</a>, hundreds of moons, 
                        and thousands of asteroids and comets.
                        Our solar system is <strong>located in the Milky Way</strong>, 
                        a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. 
                        Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called <strong>the Orion Arm</strong>,
                        or <strong>Orion Spur</strong>, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. 
                        Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about <strong>515,000 mph (828,000 kph)</strong>. 
                        It takes about <strong>230 million years</strong> to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

                                    Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” 
                                    to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."

                                <p>
                                    So far, we've only know about life on Earth, 
                                    but <a class="underline-text-link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/can-we-find-life" target="_blank">NASA is searching for life</a> 
                                    on other worlds in our solar system and beyond.

                                <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away. This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind – a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Two NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 have crossed the termination shock: Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. Voyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers exit the Oort Cloud.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Moons</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons, 
                                    although Venus does have a quasi-satellite that has officially been named Zoozve. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system’s moon counts. 
                                    In some ways, the swarms of moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <h2>Formation</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of 
                                    interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the 
                                    shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. 
                                    When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula – a spinning, 
                                    swirling disk of material.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, 
                                    the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine 
                                    and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our 
                                    Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Matter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. 
                                    These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. 
                                    Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, 
                                    becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, 
                                    planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early 
                                    solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. 
                                    Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, 
                                    and small, irregular moons.

                                    The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our 
                                    solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. 
                                    Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat 
                                    when the solar system was young. For this reason, 
                                    the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – 
                                    are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.

                                <p>Meanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, 
                                    liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. 
                                    Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where 
                                    we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants 
                                    Uranus and Neptune.

                            The universe is everything that exists — including all of space, time, matter, 
                            and energy. It contains billions of galaxies, each filled with stars, planets, 
                            gas, and dust. Our own solar system, which includes Earth, is just a tiny part of 
                            the Milky Way galaxy.
                            <br><br>Scientists believe the universe began about 13.8 billion years ago 
                            with a massive explosion called the Big Bang. Since then, it has been expanding, 
                            and it continues to do so today.
                            <br><br>The universe is incredibly vast and still full of mysteries. 
                            From black holes and dark matter to the possibility of life beyond Earth, 
                            it inspires both curiosity and wonder as we continue to explore and 
                            understand more about the cosmos.

                            An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system.

                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>
                                Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in 
                                a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. 
                                (“Small” meaning within thousands of light-years of our 
                                solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, 
                                or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) Even the closest known 
                                exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still 
                                about 4 light-years away. We know there are more 
                                planets than stars in the galaxy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By measuring exoplanets’ sizes (diameters) 
                                and masses (weights), we can see compositions ranging 
                                from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich 
                                (like Jupiter and Saturn). Some planets may be dominated 
                                by water or ice, while others are dominated by 
                                iron or carbon. We’ve identified lava worlds 
                                covered in molten seas, puffy planets the density 
                                of Styrofoam and dense cores of planets still 
                                orbiting their stars.

                            Astronomers estimate that the universe could contain up to one septillion stars – that’s a one followed by 24 zeros. Our Milky Way alone contains more than 100 billion, including our most well-studied star, the Sun.

                            Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.

                                Stars form in large clouds of gas and dust called molecular clouds. 
                                Molecular clouds range from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of 
                                the Sun and can span as much as hundreds of light-years. 
                                Molecular clouds are cold which causes gas to clump, 
                                creating high-density pockets. Some of these clumps 
                                can collide with each other or collect more matter, 
                                strengthening their gravitational force as their mass grows. 
                                Eventually, gravity causes some of these clumps to collapse. 
                                When this happens, friction causes the material to heat up, 
                                which eventually leads to the development of a protostar – 
                                a baby star. Batches of stars that have recently formed 
                                from molecular clouds are often called

                                At first, most of the protostar’s energy comes from heat released by 
                                its initial collapse. After millions of years, immense pressures and 
                                temperatures in the star’s core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms 
                                together to form helium, a process called nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion 
                                releases energy, which heats the star and prevents it from further 
                                collapsing under the force of gravity.

                            <p>
                                At the beginning of the end of a star’s life, its core runs out of hydrogen to convert into helium. The energy produced by fusion creates pressure inside the star that balances gravity’s tendency to pull matter together, so the core starts to collapse. But squeezing the core also increases its temperature and pressure, making the star slowly puff up. However, the details of the late stages of the star’s death depend strongly on its mass.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A low-mass star’s atmosphere will keep expanding until it becomes a subgiant or giant star while fusion converts helium into carbon in the core. (This will be the fate of our Sun, in several billion years.) Some giants become unstable and pulsate, periodically inflating and ejecting some of their atmospheres. Eventually, all the star’s outer layers blow away, creating an expanding cloud of dust and gas called a planetary nebula.

                                Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, 
                                much studied but not fully understood. These objects aren’t really holes. 
                                They’re huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. 
                                A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, 
                                the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – 
                                can escape. The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even 
                                the Sun’s. It’s a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up 
                                the black hole.

                                Black holes don’t emit or reflect light, making them effectively invisible to telescopes. 
                                Scientists primarily detect and study them based on how they affect their surroundings:

                                <li>Black holes can pull in gas and dust from nearby stars, 
                                    forming an accretion disk that emits X-rays.</li>
                                <li>A supermassive black hole’s intense gravity can cause stars to orbit around it in a 
                                    particular way. Astronomers tracked the orbits of several stars near the 
                                    center of the Milky Way to prove it houses a supermassive black hole, a discovery 
                                    that won the 2020 Nobel Prize.</li>
                                <li>When very massive objects accelerate through space, they create ripples in the

                                    Scientists can detect some of these by the ripples’ effect on detectors.</li>
                                <li>Massive objects like black holes can bend and distort light from more distant objects. This effect, 
                                    called gravitational lensing, can be used to find isolated black holes that are otherwise invisible.</li>

                            Astronomers generally divide black holes into three categories according to their mass: 
                            stellar-mass, supermassive, and intermediate-mass. 
                            The mass ranges that define each group are approximate, and scientists 
                            are always reassessing where the boundaries should be set. 
                            Cosmologists suspect a fourth type, primordial black holes formed during 
                            the birth of the universe, may also lurk undetected in the cosmos.

                                        When a star with more than eight times the Sun’s mass runs out of fuel, 
                                        its core collapses, rebounds, and explodes as a supernova. What’s left 
                                        behind depends on the star’s mass before the explosion. If it was near 
                                        the threshold, it creates a city-sized, superdense neutron star. If it 
                                        had around 20 times the Sun’s mass or more, the star’s core collapses 
                                        into a stellar-mass black hole.
                                    </p>

                                        The masses of these newly born objects can range from a few to hundreds 
                                        of times the Sun’s mass, depending on star’s mass when the supernova began. 
                                        Stellar-mass black holes can continue to gain mass through collisions with 
                                        stars and other black holes.

                                        Nearly all the stellar-mass black holes observed so far have been found 
                                        because they’re paired with stars. They likely originated as mismatched 
                                        stars where the more massive one evolved rapidly into a black hole. 
                                        In some cases, called X-ray binaries, the black hole pulls gas off the 
                                        star into a disk that heats up enough to produce X-rays. Binaries have 
                                        revealed around 50 suspected or confirmed stellar-mass black holes in 
                                        the Milky Way, but scientists think there may be as many as 100 million 
                                        in our galaxy alone.

                                        Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of most galaxies, including the Milky Way. 
                                        They have masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of times that of the Sun.

                                        The exact formation process of supermassive black holes is still a topic of research, 
                                        but they are thought to have formed early in the universe's history and grown over time 
                                        by accreting mass and merging with other black holes.

                                        Observations suggest that the growth of supermassive black holes is closely linked 
                                        to the evolution of their host galaxies, and they may influence galaxy formation and evolution.

                                        some intermediate-mass black holes. These should range from around

                                        Scientists theorize that primordial black holes formed in the first second after 
                                        the birth of the universe. In that moment, pockets of hot material may have been 
                                        dense enough to form black holes, potentially with masses ranging from 100,000 
                                        times less than a paperclip to 100,000 times more than the Sun’s. Then as the 
                                        universe quickly expanded and cooled, the conditions for forming black holes 
                                        this way ended.

                                        Now, 13.8 billion years later, scientists haven’t yet found definitive proof 
                                        these primordial black holes ever existed. It’s possible, however, that they 
                                        could have evaporated as the cosmos aged due to quantum mechanical processes 
                                        occurring at the edges of their event horizons. According to theoretical 
                                        predictions, lower-mass black holes (those with less mass than a mountain) 
                                        would evaporate more quickly than larger ones, which could mean many of 
                                        these early black holes have completely dissipated. But more massive primordial

                                Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust, 
                                all bound together by gravity. The largest contain trillions of stars 
                                and can be more than a million light-years across. The smallest can 
                                contain a few thousand stars and span just a few hundred light-years. 
                                Most large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, 
                                some with billions of times the Sun’s mass.

                            <p>
                                Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, 
                                as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually dubbed irregular.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. 
                                Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around 
                                13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy 
                                formed approximately 500 million years ago.
                            </p>

                                Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held together by their mutual gravity. 
                                Larger structures, called clusters, may contain thousands of galaxies. 
                                Groups and clusters can be arranged in superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound. 
                                Superclusters, empty voids, “walls” of galaxies, 
                                and other large-scale structures make up the cosmic web of matter in the universe.

                                Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with a disk of 
                                stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located along one of 
                                the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes 
                                about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way just once.

                                From our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, 
                                milky band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it 
                                got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our home 
                                galaxy seen edge on.

                                The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called the 
                                Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf galaxies (smaller galaxies 
                                with up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our nearest large galactic 
                                neighbor.

                                Around 10% of known galaxies are active, which means 
                                their centers appear more than 100 times brighter than 
                                the combined light of their stars. They can be spiral, 
                                elliptical, or irregular. The Milky Way is not currently 
                                an active galaxy, although it likely experienced a burst 
                                of activity in the past few million years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Astronomers think this excess energy comes from areas near the 
                                galaxies’ central supermassive black holes, which range from 
                                hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of our Sun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Gas and dust collect around the black hole to form an 
                                accretion disk. The black hole’s gravity compresses and 
                                heats the disk, which causes the material to glow across 
                                multiple wavelengths, from infrared to X-rays.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Infrared observations show that the black hole and its accretion disk are 
                                embedded within a clumpy ring of cooler dust, called a torus, that may be a 
                                few light-years across. Close to the black hole, a small fraction of the infalling 
                                gas can be driven outward, perpendicular to the disk, as jets of particles that 
                                move near the speed of light.
                            </p>

                                During the early 20th century, astronomers began classifying active galaxies 
                                based on the distinctive characteristics and behaviors they observed. Scientists 
                                now think viewing the centers of these galaxies at different angles – for example, 
                                seeing directly into the torus versus seeing it from the side – produce many of the 
                                signature traits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Active galaxies can also be categorized by their brightness in radio wavelengths. 
                                Radio-loud galaxies typically emit from both the accretion disk and the jets. 
                                Radio-quiet galaxies tend to have little-to-no emission from jets. The observed 
                                luminosity is also thought to be another aspect of our viewing angle. Jets 
                                directed more toward our line of sight, viewed “down the barrel,” appear brighter 
                                and more variable than those viewed at wider angles.

                                Telescopes are our eyes into the universe, allowing us to observe celestial objects 
                                across vast distances. They come in various types, including optical telescopes that 
                                capture visible light and radio telescopes that detect radio waves emitted by distant 
                                objects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Space-based telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, 
                                have revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos by providing clear images free from Earth's atmosphere.

                        <div>
                            <p>
                                These instruments have enabled groundbreaking discoveries, such as the detection of exoplanets, 
                                the observation of distant galaxies, and the study of cosmic phenomena like black holes and supernovae.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Telescopes continue to play a crucial role in advancing our knowledge of the universe, 
                                helping us answer fundamental questions about its origins, evolution, and the potential for life beyond Earth.
